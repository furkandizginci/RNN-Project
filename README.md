# RNN-Project

Sentiment analysis was performed using Recurrent Neural Network. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine which emotion class (positive, negative, or neutral) the data belong to. 
“Recurrent neural networks, also known as RNNs, are a class of neural networks that allow previous outputs to be used as inputs while having hidden states.”  
 		RNN uses short-term memory and progresses in loops.  Calculations are made based on the results of the previous loop.

The dataset to be used with RNN must be time dependent data. In this problem, IMDB Movie Review dataset is analyzed. The main purpose is the perceive the arrangement between the words are connected to each other by the algorithm and to determine which emotion class the comment belongs to.  There are two classes for this dataset, positive and negative.
